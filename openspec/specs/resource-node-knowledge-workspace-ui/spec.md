## Purpose

Define the ResourceNode-aware knowledge workspace UI contract that connects graph exploration, resource details, mapping warnings, role-scoped diagnostics, and launch actions without moving resource implementations into the knowledge UI.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Knowledge workspace supports ResourceNode-aware exploration
The system SHALL provide a knowledge/resource workspace that can display graph nodes and mapped ResourceNodes through shared workspace UI.

#### Scenario: ResourceNode mapping exists
- **WHEN** a selected knowledge node or resource has a ResourceNode mapping
- **THEN** the UI SHALL show source reference, knowledge coverage, prerequisites, availability, privacy level, teacher policy, evidence instrumentation, and path eligibility where role scope permits.

### Requirement: Partial ResourceNode coverage is explicit
The system SHALL make missing or partial ResourceNode coverage visible.

#### Scenario: Resource lacks a required mapping
- **WHEN** a resource lacks render target, launch target, knowledge mapping, availability, privacy policy, or evidence instrumentation
- **THEN** the workspace SHALL show a warning or unavailable state with a reason suitable for the current role.

### Requirement: Resource launch actions preserve source ownership
The system SHALL launch mapped resources through their existing source-of-record, registry, or feature-owned launcher contracts.

#### Scenario: User launches a mapped resource
- **WHEN** a user launches a lesson, media item, widget, simulation, Arena task, or adaptive path node from the knowledge/resource workspace
- **THEN** the UI SHALL use the ResourceNode source reference, `registryId`, route, or feature-owned launcher contract where available
- **AND** it SHALL NOT move resource implementations, lesson rendering, or Arena/simulation business logic into the knowledge workspace UI.

### Requirement: Workspace preserves current graph exploration
The system SHALL keep existing knowledge graph browsing available while ResourceNode-aware panels are introduced.

#### Scenario: ResourceNode feature flag is disabled
- **WHEN** ResourceNode-aware UI is disabled
- **THEN** the knowledge graph SHALL remain usable through the existing exploration and resource-panel behavior.

### Requirement: Graph relationship lines encode relation meaning
The knowledge graph SHALL render relation lines with distinct visual semantics for prerequisite/foundation, contains, follows/leads-to, applies-to, opposite, and related relations.

#### Scenario: Graph renders multiple relation types
- **WHEN** the graph displays different relation types
- **THEN** each type SHALL use an approved combination of color role, line style, width, arrow behavior, opacity, and legend label
- **AND** relation meaning SHALL remain distinguishable in both light and dark themes without relying on color alone.

### Requirement: Default graph view limits edge density
The knowledge graph SHALL limit default visible edges to high-signal structure and current exploration context.

#### Scenario: Graph opens with many available relations
- **WHEN** the available relation count is high
- **THEN** the default view SHALL show skeleton, hierarchy, prerequisite, follows/leads-to, and selected-context relations before weak related edges
- **AND** weaker relations SHALL be dimmed, collapsed, or hidden until selected through filters or focus interaction.

### Requirement: Graph focus reduces unrelated edge noise
The knowledge graph SHALL dim unrelated edges and emphasize selected-node neighborhoods during hover, selection, or search focus.

#### Scenario: User selects a node
- **WHEN** a node is selected or focused
- **THEN** directly relevant nodes and relations SHALL become visually prominent
- **AND** unrelated edges SHALL reduce opacity enough to make the selected neighborhood readable while preserving orientation.

### Requirement: Relation legend and filters are part of the workspace
The knowledge graph SHALL expose relation legend and filters as workspace controls aligned with the shared shell and floating action dock.

#### Scenario: User changes relation filters
- **WHEN** a user toggles relation families, density, or weak-edge visibility
- **THEN** the graph SHALL update without losing selected node context, panel state, or ResourceNode-aware launch actions
- **AND** controls SHALL not overlap the shared floating action dock.
