## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Planner consumes the control-correction seed graph
The system SHALL be able to generate candidate paths from the audited control-correction ResourceNode seed graph.

#### Scenario: Feasible control-correction path is requested
- **WHEN** the planner receives a `control-correction` goal, learner-state slice, time budget, and teacher policy
- **THEN** it SHALL select only path-eligible seed nodes whose prerequisites, availability, privacy, terminal constraints, and evidence instrumentation pass audit
- **AND** it SHALL return a candidate path that includes explanatory reasons and a terminal validation strategy when sufficient evidence exists.

#### Scenario: Required terminal validation is unavailable
- **WHEN** no audited simulation or Arena validation node is available for the requested path constraints
- **THEN** the planner SHALL return a fallback or low-confidence path state
- **AND** it SHALL explain the missing resource or mapping gap instead of silently ending with a non-validation node.
