## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Control-correction paths use simulation and Arena terminal validation
The system SHALL determine control-correction path completion from configured simulation and Arena validation evidence rather than resource views alone.

#### Scenario: Terminal validation succeeds
- **WHEN** a student completes the required simulation and Arena validation nodes with governed evidence that meets the path policy
- **THEN** the path SHALL mark terminal validation as satisfied and may transition to completed
- **AND** the completion state SHALL reference privacy-safe evidence ids, provenance, replay confidence, and validation policy version.

#### Scenario: Terminal validation fails
- **WHEN** simulation metrics fail, Arena submission is invalid or low-scoring under policy, replay confidence is insufficient, or required evidence is missing
- **THEN** the path SHALL record a failed or low-confidence validation state
- **AND** it SHALL trigger an alternative path, fallback node, Konling correction, or teacher-visible risk marker according to policy.

#### Scenario: Validation node is only preview evidence
- **WHEN** the available Arena or simulation result is preview-only
- **THEN** the path SHALL mark the result as preview-only context unless policy explicitly allows preview validation
- **AND** it SHALL NOT present preview-only evidence as official evaluation, leaderboard, or hard terminal authority.
